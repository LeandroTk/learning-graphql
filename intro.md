## what is GraphQL?
  - more flexible and more efficient alternative in client-server communication

## Example of a simple API implementation
  - using rest
  - using graphql

## Overfetching
  - fetching unnecessary data

## Underfetching
  - An endpoint doesn't return enough of data
  - Need to send multiple requests

## Benefits of Schema & Types
  - Strong type system
  - Schema as contract between client and server

## Power to the client
  - The server says: this is the things you can query (capabilities)
  - The client says: this is my current requirements

## history @facebook
  - Facebook apps built as HTML5
  - Want to build native apps
  - Thinking of APIs: they wanted a graph: users connected to stories connected to comments etc
